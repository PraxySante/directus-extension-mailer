## Authentication
Requests made by unauthenticated users will be rejected. Requests must be made with a cookie or bearer token unless guest sending is active.


## Sending Notifications
An example `POST` request made to `https://directusAppDomain/Mailer{or custom path}/`
In this example we are sending a test message to two recipients. 
```JSON
{
  "subject": "How cool is Directus?",
  "to": ["email@gmail.com", "email@hotmail.com"],
  "template": {
    "name": "default-template",
  }
}
```
### Liquid Templating ðŸ’§
You can build custom email templates with Liquid.js and add them to your `extensions/templates` folder to reference them as templates in your `POST` request. [@email templating](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/email-templates/#_1-create-a-template-file)

If you're unfamiliar with Liquid, data can be referenced in a template with this interpolation`{{title}}` [@data variables](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html)
```JSON
{
  "from": "hello@ryntab.com",
  "to": "*********@gmail.com",
  "subject": "This email was made with Handlebars",
	"template" : "alert",
	"data" : {
		"title": "Im a title!",
		"subtitle": "Im a subtitle!",
		"body": "Im the body!"
	}
}
```
### Attachments ðŸ“¦
To add attachments in your email notification, include an array of attachment objects. [@attachments](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/)
```JSON
{
  "subject": "How cool is Directus?",
  "to": "email@gmail.com",
  "template": {
    "name": "default-template",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "name": "image.png",

        },
         {

        }
    ]
  }
}
